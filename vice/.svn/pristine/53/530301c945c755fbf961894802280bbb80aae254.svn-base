- the xcode project should get fixed. currently VICE does not compile from
  within xcode. 

- vsid UI is missing

- model switching is missing for c128, DTV, plus4, vic20, pet, cbm2, cbm5x0

- VICII-Settings gives an empty dialog (open end)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cosmetical issues:

- in the drive emulation settings dialog, "2000" and "4000" entries should get
  moved up in the list

- generally the menu structure should get reworked to be similar to what windows
  and GTK ports do. (at least get rid of "options" vs "settings")
