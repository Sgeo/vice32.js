Building the SDL port of VICE:

Building in *nix compile enviroments
------------------------------------

If you have checked out the unstable svn version of VICE you need to generate
the configure script first by doing:
./autogen.sh

The stable tarball already has the configure script, so continue with:

./configure --enable-sdlui
make
make install

You'll need the SDL libs and headers. For free scaling, the OpenGL is
also needed (libGL, opengl32.dll, ...). Movie recording needs the
FFMPEG libraries and headers.

Steps to set up the needed external SDL libs for building using with minGW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You will need to download the current version of SDL headers and libs for minGW. 
   They can be found here https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
2. Locate your minGW install include directory (ex. C:\MinGW\include), and
   create a directory called SDL there (ex. C:\MinGW\include\SDL). Inside this
   directory, copy all your SDL header (.h) files extracted in the SDL 'include' 
   directory from step #1
3. Locate your minGW library directory (ex. C:\MinGW\lib). Inside this directory, 
   copy all your SDL libs (.a) files extracted into the SDL 'lib' directory from step #1
4. Follow the standard build instructions for *nix environment now
5. After making, type 'make bindist' to create the binary distribution files. They 
   will appear in a newly created SDLVICE directory. 

NOTE: The default SDL build does not statically link the mingw and sdl runtime libs, 
so you will need to locate and copy the SDL.dll from found in step #1 and the minGW 
libstdc++.dll & libgcc.dll files from the minGW (ex. C:\MinGW\bin) directory to a global
windows path (ex. \WINDOWS\system32) or you can just drop them in the local SDLVICE 
binary dir so they can be found during runtime.
