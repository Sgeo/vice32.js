    NOTE: fall-off cycles are heavily chip- and temperature dependant. as a
          consequence it is very hard to find suitable realistic values that
          always work and we can only tweak them based on testcases. (unless we
          want to make it configureable or emulate temperature over time =))

          it probably makes sense to tweak the values for a warmed up CPU, since
          this is likely how (old) programs were coded and tested :)

          see testprogs/CPU/cpuport for details and tests
