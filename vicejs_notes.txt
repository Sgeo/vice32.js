Trying to compile VICE for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS based on https://pigeon.neocities.org/vice.html

Current commands:

export ar_check=no
./configure --enable-sdlui --with-sdlsound --without-png --without-uithreads --without-resid
make
emconfigure ./configure --enable-sdlui --with-sdlsound --without-png --without-uithreads --without-resid
emmake make
emmake make clean
emmake make x64
cd ..
./build-x64


Using ./configure line from https://github.com/rjanicek/vice.js/blob/9b3e5f21489f96967d649790d3c915ac3127c6ec/build#L16, without the --without-residfp flag

Needed sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0 libsdl2-dev for the configuration to succeed. Possibly sdl1 files, those were installed too, but probably not.


On run, stating stuff about HardSID. Going to try removing --without-resid:

./configure --enable-sdlui --with-sdlsound

That compiles and tries to run but segfaults. Trying tag v3.2

Trying to just run that configure with emscripten. Commenting out an ar truncating check with "export ar_check=no", that works.

Adding --without-png to config


Complains about SDL_keysym.h. Trying --enable-sdlui2 instead of --enable-sdlui. Might break modifier keys.

Using build-x64 build script (not the top of the file). Removing a line about vice/src/platform. Complaints about forced memory

Removing forced memory parameter. Complaints about duplicate console_close. Trying removing references to console.c and console from Makefiles in vice/src/arch/sdl

Seems to work, now getting error: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../js/x64.js.mem'
Trying making a js directory first. That works.

Trying to load the HTML file: LinkError: import object field '__mouse_enabled' is not a Number
Trying adding  ../vice/src/joyport/*.o \ to build-x64.sh... worked for that error
TTrying adding ../vice/src/samplerdrv/*.o \ ... That worked, onto the next one?
../vice/src/tapeport/*.o \
../vice/src/mididrv/*.o \

Adding -s USE_SDL=2 to build-x64

Works, but then a function was still not visible, possibly browser cache problems

Unable to load kernal ROM, adding -s EMTERPRETIFY=1 -s EMTERPRETIFY_ASYNC=1

Didn't help

Trying changing --embed-file to ../vice/data

Changing it to "bin@/" works. Considering changing it to use the data files from the original source.

Now complaining about main loop. Making change to main.c. Not bothering with compiler directives at this point.

Complaints about emscripten_set_main_loop_timing resolved with a dummy_main_loop, a call to emscripten_set_main_loop(dummy_main_loop, 0, 0) at the beginning, and a call to emscripten_cancel_main_loop() before setting main loop.

No errors, but blank screen. Adding back async settings.

No change, tried removing emscripten_set_main_loop(maincpu_mainloop). No change

Going to try removing sound... no effect(?!)

Repointing embed-files to "../vice/data@/". No negative effect

Trying adding an emscripten_cancel_main_loop() before starting the Emterpretified main loop.... Did not help

Reviewing effort involved in making VICE main loop safe...added static to some variables, added a check to only reset machine once, removed loop, added the mainloop as an emscripten main loop... result, still same issues.

Trying --without-uithreads in ./configure

Trying export CFLAGS=-s EMTERPRETIFY=1 EMTERPRETIFY_ASYNC=1 before emconfigure

No result, trying manual change in post-configure Makefile.... No change

Trying from scratch: A ./configure and make beforehand, before Emscripten, is critical to build a native executable called "gentranslate". And "make" without x64 is needed at some point to build dynamically generated .h files.

Trying SDL1... for some reason, wants #include <string.h> in vice.h. Resid functions failing, trying --without-resid
